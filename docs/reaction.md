# Reaction Time

The screen will turn black. The user will be given a countdown, from 3. On 0, a white dot about a centimeter wide will show in a random area of the screen. The user must tap the dot as fast as possible. After they tap each dot, it will disappear and be replaced with another dot in a different place on the screen. The user is graded by the total time taken and the average time per dot. The goal is to tap all of the dots as quickly as possible.

A total of 15 dots will be given to the user, with the position randomized seeded by the current time.
