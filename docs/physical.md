# Physical Interface Control Test

The user will be prompted to hold their device as flat as possible, with two hands. The test begins when the user taps the start button.

A large, blue-colored dot will appear on the screen, along with a target. The user must hold the device as flat as possible. The dot will roll around the screen like a ball, limited by the bounds of the screen. The user is scored by how close they can hold the ball to the target's bulls-eye. More points are awarded for more time spent over the concentric circles closest to the bulls-eye.

The user will be tested for a total of 15 seconds.
